Subject: Urgent: Patient Data and Treatment Updates

Hey Laura,

Hope you’re doing well. Just a heads-up – this email has some sensitive patient info, so keep it under wraps and make sure only the right folks see it.

So, here’s the scoop. Richard Cooper (Patient ID: PAT234567, SSN: 345-67-8901) has a history of hypertension and diabetes. We adjusted his insulin therapy on June 15, 2024, and changed his blood pressure meds on July 10, 2024.

Then there’s Jennifer Taylor (Patient ID: PAT234568, SSN: 456-78-9012). She has asthma and allergies. We updated her inhaler prescription on June 20, 2024, and did allergy testing and a new treatment plan on July 12, 2024.

Check out the attached files and update the records when you get a chance. If you’ve got any questions or need more info, just give me a shout.

Thanks,

Mike
