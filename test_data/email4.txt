Subject: Confidential: Legal Case Updates

Hey Alex,

Hope everything’s good with you. Just wanted to update you on a couple of cases. Make sure this stays between us and the team.

So, for John Parker, there’s been some progress. On June 22, 2024, there was a deposition where Parker mentioned his former employer's negligence. Then, on July 15, 2024, we filed a motion for summary judgment based on the new evidence.

For Sarah Miller, things have moved forward too. On June 30, 2024, she agreed to a settlement offer, and we finalized the terms on July 18, 2024. Keeping this under wraps is crucial until everything’s finalized.

Check the attached docs for all the details and update our records when you can. If you need more info or have questions, just hit me up.

Cheers,
